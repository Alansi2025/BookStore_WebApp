#Project Structure üìÇ
For the application to run correctly, your project must follow this folder structure:

/bookstore-project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ static/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ books.books.json
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt

#Setup and Installation üöÄ
Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

1. Prerequisites
Python 3.8+

MongoDB installed and running.

pip and virtualenv for managing Python packages.

2. Clone the Repository
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/bookstore-project.git](https://github.com/your-username/bookstore-project.git)
cd bookstore-project

3. Backend Setup
a. Create and activate a virtual environment:

# For Windows
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# For macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

b. Install the required Python packages:
(First, create a requirements.txt file with the following content)

# requirements.txt
Flask
pymongo
PyJWT
werkzeug
flask-cors

Now, run the installation command:

pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Database Setup
a. Import the sample data into MongoDB:
Make sure the MongoDB service is running. Open a new terminal and run the mongoimport command.

mongoimport --uri "mongodb://localhost:27017/books" --collection books --file books.books.json --jsonArray

This will create a books database and a books collection populated with the sample data.

5. Run the Application
a. Start the Flask server:

python app.py

You should see a message indicating a successful connection to MongoDB.

b. Open the application in your browser:
Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000. The website should load and display the book carousels.
